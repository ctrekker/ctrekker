Hey! I'm Connor, an avid coder and want-to-be computer science researcher. Currently studying Computer Science at [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/), but that will change to Physics next semester.

## âš¡ What I'm Coding âš¡
### ðŸ§ª [JuliaSim](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliasim/)
### ðŸŽˆ [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl)
What you see is what you REST, a feature that exposes an API to interact with Pluto.jl notebooks
